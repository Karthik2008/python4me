# The below example shows you "How To Define A type And Print Its Type."
# Let us assign an integer and a string with number 1 and define the type.
num1 = 1
num2 = "1"
print (num1)
print (num2)

# The output of above code prints 1 and 1 which looks similar but one is integer and one is string.
# To find the type we use the following method: type()

print(type(num1))
print(type(num2)) .
